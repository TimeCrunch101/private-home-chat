## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the process outlined below:

1. **Contact Us**: Report vulnerabilities by emailing our security team at [security@cincitechlabs.com](mailto:security@cincitechlabs.com). Please include as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and any potential impact.
  
2. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge your report within 2 business days and will provide a detailed response within 10 business days indicating the next steps.

3. **Handling the Report**:
   - If the vulnerability is valid, we'll work on a fix and keep you updated.
   - We'll credit your contribution unless you prefer otherwise.
   - We'll keep the details confidential until a fix is deployed.
   - If the issue is not accepted, we'll provide a rationale for the decision.

4. **Security Updates**: Once a fix is implemented, weâ€™ll release a patch and notify the community about the update.

Thank you for helping keep our project secure!
